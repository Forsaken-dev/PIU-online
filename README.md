# PIU-online
In this repository, the online betas of Pump It Up will be published (from the 2015 Prime version to the 20th anniversary version).

# Here will go the documentation and how to install / set the server for online mode

Things we are going to do are enable UCS for older versions and make a website that saves data and people can make a profile for saving the data.

maybe a fake host can fix the UCS problem but not the saving data, even tho it's via USB, the versions that I have are with no dongle (PIU 2015 and 2018)

I'm currently checking the 2015, which is a old one

I wanna find a way to emulate Andamiros (am.pass) service for saving data, however I'll have to use Wireshark with the VM (I made it run on a virtual machine)

Any new changes will go here, or in the project documentation, I'll try to include screenshots, any help is welcome
